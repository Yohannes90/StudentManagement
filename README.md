# StudentManagement

Student Management System.
 This project is a student management system designed for schools to manage all the student’s data like their personal information course enrolement, grades,     which year are they in, and so on.
 It plays a great role in organizing the school information throughout the whole year.
 Any school stores a lot of information and needs the help of an SMS to store, track, maintain and keep the information organized in a safe and secure way.

Why i chose to build this project as learning tool.
